\begin{enumerate}
    \item Background, motivation and Project Thesis (Oscar and All)
    
    This project compares several related models and approaches to predict market crashes using market data.
    
    \item Objectives and Success Criteria (Adrien)
    
        Objectives (will write them more thoroughly):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Find and correctly implement commonly used models for Time Series Analysis in our context
            \item[-] Run and Analyze Results on the multiple scenarios across all models
            \item[-] Compare the results of each model and discuss their strengths and weaknesses
            \item[-] Conclude the most favorable approach indicated by our results and compare with literature
        \end{itemize} 
        Success Criteria
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [-] Implement the models correctly so the empirical comparison between models depends on their strength and not their
            \item [-] All models should achieve at least the expectation of them found in literature
            \item [-] Comparison of the models should show their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios
            \item [-] Our final report should adequately compare our methods and results with the ones found in literature
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Project Plan and timeline (Adrien and All)
        
        Project plan (Draft)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [-] Literature Review
            \item [-] Implementation of models and training
            \item [-] Analysis, Final Report and presentation work
        \end{itemize}
    
        Timeline
        
        \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={align=center, font =\small}]
          \draw[->] (0,0) -- (14,0);
        
          \foreach \x/\y/\label in {
            2/{Literature\\Review}/8th of November,
            7/{Implementation of \\ models and training}/Mid November,
            12/{Analysis, Final Report \\ and Presentation}/End of November
          } {
            \draw (\x,0) node[above=5pt] {\y} node[below=5pt] {\label};
          }
        \end{tikzpicture}    
        
    \item Discussing some datasets and how we will implement our project (platform, etc) (Inigo)
