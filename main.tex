    \item Background, motivation and Project Thesis (Oscar and All)

    There have been several crashes in the market history. They also come with severe consequences. In 1929, one of the biggest market crashes in history came before the largest worldwide economic crisis in history. When the market crashes, individual investors often lose money by panic selling which will cause more crashes. Nowadays, machine learning can help statisticians and economists predict market crashes and prevent them from happening.

    Before learning how the models work, we need to first define what indicates a market crash. Normally
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item Define what indicates a market crash.
    \end{enumerate}

    In this project, we will see:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
      \item Autoregressive Model
      \item Moving Average Model
      \item Autoregressive Moving Average Model (ARIMA)
    \end{enumerate}
    We will see how these model works and compare their result on:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
      \item Accuracy
      \item Efficiency
    \end{enumerate}
    
    This project aims to compare several commonly used models to predict market crashes using market data.
    
    \item Objectives and Success Criteria (Adrien)
    
        Objectives
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] Find and correctly implement commonly used models for Time Series Analysis in our context
            \item[-] Run and Analyze Results on the multiple scenarios across all models
            \item[-] Compare the results of each model and discuss their strengths and weaknesses
            \item[-] Conclude the most favorable approach indicated by our results and compare with literature
        \end{itemize} 
        Success Criteria
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [-] Implement the models correctly so the empirical comparison between models depends on their strength and not their
            \item [-] All models should achieve at least the expectation of them found in literature
            \item [-] Comparison of the models should show their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios
            \item [-] Our final report should adequately compare our methods and results with the ones found in literature
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Project Plan and timeline (Adrien and All)
        
        Project plan
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [-] Literature Review: Find models and datasets with which we can work, gather their expected performance and their original implementation
            \item [-] Implementation of models and training: Implement each model to at least the satisfaction outlined in our Success Criteria
            \item [-] Analysis, Final Report and presentation
        \end{itemize}
