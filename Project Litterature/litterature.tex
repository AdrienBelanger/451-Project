\justifying % justifying our text instead of the annoying list like last time

Overall objective to keep in mind:

"In this milestone, the objective is to review the related literature to your proposal. This will better inform your methodology for your project if it involves a new idea, and it is necessary if you are comparing existing methods for a certain domain. It may even lead to a change of proposal, once you learn about existing methods out there. If you are producing a literature survey on a research topic, in this stage, you just provide a "breadth" review, in which you emphasize covering as many related works as possible and providing some preliminary organization without going into much detail."\\

Evaluation Criterias:

- Putting your proposal into context of related literature

- Coverage (are you adequately covering most relevant works)

\subsection*{Introduction \textcolor{red}{Adrien (Goes with Background)} }
"Start with a broad picture of the research area in order to position your work. It is important to demonstrate perspective."

\subsection*{Background on Time Series and Financial Market Crashes \textcolor{red}{Adrien}}

- Define time series in financial analysis

\cite{}

- Explain market crashes and justify our definition

- Review work on financial crash prediction, review different methods

- Identify gaps in literature that our project adresses and what is new about it

\subsection*{Review of Relevant Models and Methods }
- Justify why we chose those three models by finding similar work \textcolor{red}{Oscar ?}
    \subsubsection*{Arima \textcolor{red}{Oscar}}
    - Overview of ARIMA 

    - Review its application in time series analysis in our context
    \subsubsection*{Reccurent Neural Networks \textcolor{red}{Adrien}}
    - Overview of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

    - Review its application in time series analysis in our context
    \subsubsection*{Transformers \textcolor{red}{Inigo}}
    - Overview of Transformers

    - Review its application in time series analysis in our context


\subsection*{Criterias and Analysis \textcolor{red}{Oscar?}}
- Summarize criterias and metrics in literature for comparing models.

- Justify the selection of those comparison methods based on sources



\subsection*{Adapt proposal: \textcolor{red}{Inigo}}
